# DirectAdmin Incremental Backup Manager by ModMaster.Pro

We have build a plugin for incremental  backups (local&remote) and would like to welcome to you test it. 

Plugin URL for install using plugin manager: https://download.modmaster.pro/directadmin/backup_manager/backup_manager.tar.gz
This is full featured 30 days trial version.
For remote backup it requires sshpass to be installed  (some bug with auto install to be fixed)

We are welcome for any suggestions, bugs reports, issues.

Cheers,
Dmitry
